* HTML doc hosting in python
  - [x] Basic get pdoc running
  - [ ] Elegant thing for user configuration
  - [ ] Nice way to close the running server
  - [ ] Figure out how to start a little server for other languages (say ldoc and doxygen)
  -- [ ]  As a subtask, nice constructor for users to run their own servers and documentation engines (that way we dont have to make 1000)

* Documentation to norg
  - [ ] Parse treesitter html per documentation type, turn it into norg
  -- [ ] Make a mapping /html_node/â†’ /norg node/, and then generate the norg stuff
  - [-] do it without treesitter and without importing code (use ast, no need for incremental parsing)

* Plans
 ** Here is a great idea

* Ephemeral notes
 ** If we can map from html nodes to norg nodes, can we just parse any static site?
 ** If we can map from html nodes to norg nodes, can we reverse the mapping and make a statics site?
